# Car Park Counter

The **Car Park Counter** is a computer vision project using OpenCV to count cars in a car park. It provides real-time information on available car spaces, helping drivers make parking decisions.

## How it Works

1. Background Subtraction: Isolates moving cars from the static background.
2. Object Detection and Tracking: Identifies and tracks individual vehicles.
3. Car Counting: Keeps track of cars entering and leaving.

## Results and Display

The car count and available spaces are shown in real-time on the screen.
